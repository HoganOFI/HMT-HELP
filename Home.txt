## Determining Left- or Right-Eye Configuration and Dominance

![](RackMultipart20200422-4-zzo1ze_html_311536209ab22c87.png)

_Figure 7 - Left or Right Configuration_

First, it is important to determine your dominant eye, to do so, follow the simple instructions below. Viewing the HMT&#39;s display with your dominant eye will allow for the most clear and comfortable use of the device.

Eye dominance is the tendency to prefer visual input from one eye to the other. It is best to use your dominant eye when viewing the display.

![](RackMultipart20200422-4-zzo1ze_html_4eea7ecdbc41ac79.png)

_Figure 8 - Form a Triangle_

**To determine which eye is dominant:**

1. Form a triangle with your hands placed together at arms length.
2. 2. With both eyes open, focus on any distant object centered in the triangle.
3. Maintaining focus on the object centered in the triangle, close your right eye.
4. If the object is still in the triangle, you are left eye dominant.
5. Maintaining focus on the object centered in the triangle, close your left eye.
6. If the object is still in the triangle, you are right eye dominant.
7. If the object is in the triangle with either eye then you are dominant eye neutral.
8. Repeat test to confirm.
